### Step 1: Soothing

After getting this pet, summon it, and wait until she says one of the following lines:

>   Mama? Mama! Why is it so dark? It's scary here...
>   Can anybody hear me?
>   C-c-cold...

Here you should `/whistle` at her. Then she will say:

>   Hello? Who's there? I heard you!
>   Who are you? Can you help me?
>   It's so dark! I can't see a thing!

Then `/roar` at her.

>   Ack! A monster!
>   Help! HELP!

Then she will disappear. Re-summon her at once and `/cry`. She will empathise with you.

>   Are you sad too? Are you lost like me?
>   At least we're together now. We just... don't know where we are.
>   But you're my friend, and I know it's gonna be okay.
>   I wish I could see better. It's always so dark here!



### Step 2: Befriending

Travel to **Shattrath City** and summon her. When she sees **A'dal** she will say:

>   What's that? A light in the darkness! It's so bright...
>   It's too bright! Too bright! Owww!

Travel to **Lake Falathim, Ashenvale** and summon her. Reach the moonlight at 18.94 41.54 and she will say:

>   It's gotten a little brighter! I can see... sorta.
>   Oh, hi! Who are you? I'm Uuna. Wanna be friends? Maybe together we can get outta this place.
>   I wish Nuu were here. He'd know what to do.

Travel to **Eredath** with **Goblin Glider Kit**, and head for 24.16 58.70. Use the glider to float to the isles. Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUbk7_IxTZg) for detail. Upon reaching the house on the isle you'll find **Nuu**, to whom **Uuna** will say:

>   Nuu-Nuu! I was scared I'd never see you again! How did you get here?
>   Nuu is here to help us, friend. I knew you'd find us, Nuu!
>   I'll hold onto him so he doesn't get lost again.

Travel to **Bloodmyst Isle** and head for 56.3 56.5. **Uuna** will pick up the wand on the table and say:

>   I used to have a wand like that! Lost it a long time ago.
>   It shoots stars! Bad guys really hate that.

Travel to **Shadowmoon Valley (Draenor)** and head for 56.0 41.1. **Uuna** will pick up the crown from the chair and say:

>   A crown! So pretty!
>   You can't fight the dark without a crown, friend. It's the rules.
>   I feel a lot better now.

Then she will be kidnapped by the void and say:

>   It's dark again! Where did you go? Don't leave me!
>   No! Let me go! Help, friend! HELP!

Then you'll be unable to summon her anymore. You must kill yourself and speak to a Spirit Healer:

>   I'm looking for a little girl named Uuna, have you seen her?

and it will answer:

>   I have heard the cries of the child you speak of.
>   I shall mark you, that you may pass into this realm and seek her out.
>   She resides in a place where the barrier between the realms of life and death are thin, and spill over into your world.
>   Be warned, you have no power in this place, it's denizens cannot be harmed by mortals.
>   Try as you might, you may not be able to aid your friend.



### Step 3: Saving

Travel to **Emerald Dragonshrine, Dragonblight**, and head for 66.16 74.52. You'll find a large skull of dragon with a gem in its eye. Click on it to begin the scenario. You will be teleported into **A Dark Place**.

`/cheer` at **Uuna** and put your **Cooking Fire** beside her. She will say:

>   Friend? Is that you?
>   I won't give up, friend! I promise!
>   I'm just so cold, and it's very dark here. I don't know what to do!
>
>   There you are! That's much better.
>   They're gonna be here, soon, friend.
>   I keep running and running... but they always find me.
>   But now you're here. Together we can fight them! I think...
>   Promise you won't leave me, friend. Even when it gets dark...
>   They're here...
>   Go away! We're not afraid of you!

And here you will find **Soul Eaters** running towards **Uuna**. You must bump yourself into them so they will disappear. Check the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ3-E6kKLpw) for details. At last the **Soul Eaters** will be too many for you to scare away, and then **Uuna** will say:

>   Friend? Are you still there? I'm scared!
>   I--I can't do it! I just wanna go home!
>   Uuna wraps her arms around herself and begins to cry.

Upon hearing this, `/hug` her at once and she will say:

>   F-friend, you're here! You didn't leave me!
>   Mama told me the Light would always find me. That's you, friend. You're my light!
>   And as long as my light is with me, there's no way the darkness can win!
>   My light is super strong!
>   I'M NOT GONNA BE AFRAID ANYMORE!
>   I am ready. Let us begin the ritual.
>   The darkness is gone! I can see!
>   Oh, friend! We did it! We beat them!
>   What... what's happening?
>   The light... it's telling me to follow it...
>   Mama! Papa! They're waiting for me!
>   Wait a sec...
>   There's so much I never got to do. So many places I never got to see...
>   Is it okay if I stay with my friend? For just a little while longer?
>   Friend! The Light says I can stay! Woo-hoo!
>   Tell Mama and Papa I miss them, and... and I'll see them soon!
>   Okay, friend, let's get outta here! We have so many places to go!
>   Uuna hugs you.

And then scare all **Soul Eaters** away. However, if you fail to `/hug` her quickly, then another ending will appear:

>   Gaaahhh! No! Help!
>   Uuna is swallowed by darkness.

And this means you need to redo this step.



### Step 4: Touring

Travel to the following places:

-   Gate of the Setting Sun (8 59), Vale of the Eternal Blossoms

    (middle of the courtyard in front of the giant gate from the Vale side)

    >   Wow! That's the biggest wall I've ever seen!
    >   What do you suppose they wanted to keep out?
    >   Is it bugs? I bet it's bugs. Yuck! I hate bugs!
    >   Ewwwww!!

-   Nighthold (62.2 83.8), Suramar

    (right in front of the structure in the courtyard with the fountain)

    >   Wow! That's gotta be the prettiest house ever!
    >   Do you know who lives here? I bet it's a princess.
    >   Do you wanna play princesses with me?

-   Krasus Landing, Dalaran - Broken Isles

    (anywhere on that Landing)

    >   Whoa... a flying city! Are you serious?!
    >   How does it do that?
    >   Do you live here?
    >   Come to think of it... do you live ANYwhere?

-   Wyrmrest Tower (57.8 54.3), Dragonblight

    (western door to the Wyrmrest tower)

    >   Hey, what are those flying things? They're so pretty!
    >   That's a big tower. It's like a... giant birdhouse!
    >   But for lizard birds.
    >   Can I have one for a pet?

-   Nordrassil (59 24), Mount Hyjal

    (southwestern lake shore under Nordrassil)

    >   Friend, look! We're under a giant tree!
    >   I wonder how many birds live in that tree. Must be so many!
    >   Like... TEN birds!
    >   Caw caw caw caw caw!

-   Neverest Summit (44.8 52.5), Kun-Lai Summit

    (Neverest Summit near the statue)

    >   I can see everything from here!
    >   I didn't know mountains could go this high!
    >   Don't fall off, friend! I'll be okay if I fall, but you'd go SPLAT!
    >   So be careful, okay?

-   Blackrock Mountain (17.8 31.4 outside, 37 67 inside), Burning Steppes

    (circular ramp around the central area of Blackrock Mountain)

    >   Where are we? Why is it so smoky?
    >   Look down there. It's all glowing!
    >   But it's moving like water... it's a glowing lake?
    >   That's really silly, friend.

-   Temple of Karabor (70.65 46.55), Shadowmoon Valley (Draenor)

    (Temple of Karabor courtyard, after the stairway and the fountain, where the small crowd of draenei is standing)

    >   It's... so beautiful...
    >   My people are here! They survived!
    >   They didn't all die on Argus?

    

### Epilogue

After all the steps, **Uuna** will give you `/hug`s, and say

>   Thank you SO MUCH for showing me this, friend!
>   You've shown me so many neat things. You really are the best friend ever!
>   I know someday I'll have to go back to Mama and Papa.
>   But... not yet.

and her appearance will be renewed in your pet journal, shimmering in the Light.
