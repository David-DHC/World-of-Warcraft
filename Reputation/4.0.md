    -   Clearing the trashes gives some 15/50 reputation (depending on whether its "small" or "large"), but this is up to Revered.
    -   Each of the first 4 bosses gives 250 rep, and each of the last 3 bosses gives 400, both up to Exalted.

Guides:

1.  Do the 4/5 dailies in **Tol Barad Peninsula** (1350/1500 reputation in total)  as well as the 3 dailies in **Tol Barad** (1050 reputation in total). To get access to **Tol Barad** dailies, your faction must win the previous battleground and get control of the zone. The dailies in **Tol Barad** will be reset if your faction gets a consecutive win. You can get up to 9 dailies in **Tol Barad** each day.
2.  Each daily will give you 1 Tol Barad Commendation to purchase the awards of this faction. There's also a weekly quest asking you to win a battle which gives 3 Tol Barad Commendation.
3.  Clearing mobs in **Baradin Hold** also gives a small amount of reputation (70 reputation per trash/boss).
