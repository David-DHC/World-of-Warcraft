### Argent Dawn

|      Achievement       |                 The Argent Champion*                  |

Guides:

Do the following quests starting from Fiona's Caravan in Eastern Plagueland:

-   Gidwin Goldbraids
-   Just Encased
-   Greasing the Wheel
-   Tarenar Sunstrike
-   What I Do Best
-   A Gift For Fiona
-   Onward, to Light's Hope Chapel
-   Traveling Companions
-   Rough Roads
-   The Trek Continues
-   Boys Will Be Boys
-   A Boyhood Dream
-   Argent Call: The Trial of the Crypt
-   Argent Call: The Noxious Glade

Thus you will unlock the reputation of Argent Dawn, starting from Revered. Then you will need to do the repeatable **Annals of the Silver Hand** quest, which needs you to farm Stratholme (entering from the East entrance). Each time you finish this quest, you will be given 2000 reputation, until exalted.

|         Title          | Guardian of Cenarius* |
|      Achievement       | Guardian of Cenarius* |

Guides:

1.  Clear quests in Silithus (not 8.0 phase, but the earlier one) and the Desolace. Each quests give 500 reputation.

2.  Farm Twilight members in Silithus, and each of them gives 10 reputation, up to exalted.

3.  Twilight members in Silithus also drops **Encrypted Twilight Text**, every 10 of which can be turned in for 500 reputation, up to exalted. 

    Warning: don't turn these text in to the decrypter located in a cave in south Silithus, as he grants no reputation.

4.  Once per day you can farm the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj raid, which gives around 3000 reputation. There's also a strange but effecient way to farm this raid without having to reset: 

    -   Enter the **Temple of Ahn'Qiraj** raid, and kill everything up to **the room of General Rajaxx**, the 2nd boss (including the 1st boss). You'll see several piles of mobs standing between you and the General.

    -   Ride your mount and pull all these mobs behind you, but don't ever touch the boss. (If you unfortunately do so, run all the way and leave the raid.)

    -   Kill all the mobs outside the room of the General, and then he will come to you. As soon as he moves towards you, use abilities such as **Invisibility** to leave combat.

        Warning: invisibility are ineffective to the mobs, so don't use that until you clear all mobs and see the General coming.

    -   You'll find the boss running back to his initial place, and the mobs will respawn. 

    A single run of this takes 1-2 minutes and gives 500 reputation, up to exalted.

Guides:

1.  Acquire some **Fiery Core** and **Lava Core**. Make sure the number of them, in total, is no less than 21. You can buy them from Auction House. It seems that **Lava Core** is much cheaper.

2.  Bring them to **Lokhtos Darkbargainer** in Blackrock Depths. Turning in every one of them to him gives 2000 reputation, up to exalted, thus 21 of them would be enough.

    Warning: The route to that npc in Blackrock Depth is way too complex. Check out in Youtube for a guide video.
