(To know how to unlock Nazjatar, check the [Unlocking Zones Guide](https://david-dhc.github.io/World-of-Warcraft/Events/UnlockingZones.html) for detail.)

### Pre-requisites:

-   Unlock Nazjatar world quests by finishing the **A Tempered Blade** quest.

### Step 1: Unlock the rotation

1.   Find **Mrrl** in Nazjatar (48.2 45.2), and complete **A Safer Place** & **No Backs** quests.
2.   Purchase **Benthic Cloak**s from **Artisan Itanu** in **Mezzamere**, until it drops **Azsh'ari Stormsurger Cape**.
3.   While wearing this cape, you can find one more item from **Mrrl**'s goods. This item resets each day, and normally **Crimson Tidestallion** will appear twice or thrice per month.

### Step 2: Trading game

-   What can be done before **Crimson Tidestallion** appears in **Mrrl**'s goods is to find **Murloco** in his cave at 46.5 32.7. Kill the nagas around him until he becomes a vendor and sells you **Hungry Herald's Tentacle Taco**. If you don't find him there, wait for his respawn.

-   What must be done on the exact day when **Crimson Tidestallion** appears in **Mrrl**'s goods is to do the following trades (not necessarily in this sequence though). Note that the **Dirty Murloc Sock** can be washed into **Clean Murloc Sock** by clicking it while swimming.
