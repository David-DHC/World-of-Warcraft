### Step 1: Strange Goop

Buy **Strange Goop** from AH (usually costs 10-50k Gold), or fish it from the water area where **Hirukon** spawns.



### Step 2: A Tale of Vashj

Take **Strange Goop** to **Baroness Vashj** in **Maldraxxus** (57.6 92.0). Talk to her and she will ask you for 3 more materials to make you an **Aurelid Lure**. Apparently these materials can be found from where **Vashj** lived before: **Vashj'ir**, **Nazjatar**, **Zangarmarsh**.

-   Go to the hall before the entrance of **Serpentshrine Cavern**, and fish **Pungent Blobfish** from **Pungent Blobfish School**.
-   Go to **Nazjatar** (72.8 24.3), and fish **Flipper Fish** from **Flipper Fish School**. This fish will flop once you loot it so you must chase and catch it.
-   Go to **Shimmering Expanse** (34.7 75.0), on the balcony of a tower on the 2nd level of ruins you can find **Coilclutch Vine**.

With all these materials in your hand, go back to **Baroness Vashj** for your **Aurelid Lure**.



### Step 3: Hirukon

Once the **Aurelid Lure** is applied, an **Aurelid School** will appear in the water area where **Hirukon** spawns. Fish and loot in this school to summon **Hirukon**. The one who summons it will be guaranteed to loot the mount, while others will only have a small chance.

**Hirukon** can be looted once per day, and you can get a new **Aurelid Lure** once per week by telling **Baroness Vashj** that you have lost your previous one.
