Actually it's a guide on how to farm **Apexis Crystal**.



### Guaranteed reward each day

-   Head for **Scout Valdez** in your Garrison, beside whom lies a table where you can choose from two dailies. Choose the group one (usually leading you to **Shattrath** or **The Pit**) to earn more reward. You'll get 1000 **Apexis Crystal** by turning in this quest.

-   Head for **Lion's Watch** and finish the dailies there.
    -   Unseen Influence: 1500 **Apexis Crystal**
    -   2500 **Apexis Crystal** for the first assault daily. The assault itself will normally give 2000 **Apexis Crystal**, with **Throne of Kil'jaeden** being the special one and giving 2500.
    -   1500 **Apexis Crystal** for the following two dailies. Considering that one of the dailies requires 2 more assault, another 4000.



### Others

-   Buy **Scouting Missive** with 200 **Garrison Resource** from **Sergent Crowler** in your Garrison. Different **Scouting Missives** cost the same, but reward differently. The **Shattrath City** ones rewards most, 1800 per run.
-   Several rare elites drop **Apexis Crystal**s. Mobs across **Tanaan** also drops a little.
-   Finish the **The Liberation of Shattrath** follower mission when it pops up.
-   **Lunarfall Inn** dungeon dailies also give some **Apexis Crystal** in the reward crate.
-   Completing the **Garrison Invasion** will give 30-75 **Apexis Crystal** per run.



When you collect 100k **Apexis Crystal** you will earn the **Master of Apexis** achievement and unlock a **Garrison Monument**.
